Hello and welcome to my academic website! Here you can find information about my research, publications, and other news (such as museum expiditions and outreach). I'm an [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](http://www.ou.edu/eeb/) doctoral student in the [Miller Lab](http://mj-miller.net/) at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, Department of Ornithology and The University of Oklahoma (OU), [Department of Biology](http://www.ou.edu/cas/biology.html). Prior to OU, I earned a Masters degree in [Jeff Peters Lab](http://people.wright.edu/jeffrey.peters) at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. My thesis focused on population genomics in the Australian Teals (Genus: _Anas_). Prior to my Masters Degree, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Zoology and Latin American Studies during which I did population genetics in _Carica papaya_ in the [Moore Lab](https://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/biology/about/faculty/moore/index.html). 

Feel free to get in touch for questions or comments!
