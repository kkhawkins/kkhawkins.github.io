I am excited to report that the ddRAD-seq libraries for Chapter 1 (Woodpecker Species Delimitation) is nearing completion. A great deal of sequence data to come shortly.

Furthermore, I am collaborating on a NGS project funded through ODWC with the [Broughton Lab from OU](http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/dna/index.html) and OU PhD candidate [Anuj Guruacharya](http://www.anuj2054.com/). We are in the data processing stage of the project which will look population genetics in a set of Chub fishes in Oklahoma. We are excited to see the cleaned data and analyze the genomic variation across various Chub populations across the great state of Oklahoma.

Many changes to come. Stay Tuned.

As always, do not hesitate to get in touch!

3 Manuscipts in prep! Wish me (us) luck!
