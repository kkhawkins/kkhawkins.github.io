I am underway with my first chapter of my dissteration working on hybridization genomics in the Woodpeckers! 

We were able to install our new computational machine (which consists of 36 Cores) for genomic assembly and computation analysis. We have named our computational machine "StormTrooper"!!!

As my first chatper begins, I will be focusing NGS of samples I collected alongside [Dr. Miller](mj-miller.net) during Summer 2016. Feild Season 2017 will begin in 2 weeks, so stay tuned for data on our collection efforts at the [Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History](http://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/)
