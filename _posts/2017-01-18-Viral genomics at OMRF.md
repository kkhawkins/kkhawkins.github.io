Over the last few days Dr. Miller and I drove the 30 minute to the [Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation](https://omrf.org/) to complete libary preps on the cDNA viral genomics Dr. Miller obtained during his field work in Bolivia. 

This was an a great experience learning genomic library prep of viral genomes and learn a lot about how various Illumina machines work.

Thank you [Dr. Wiley](https://omrf.org/research-faculty/scientist/wiley-graham/) for all of your help.
