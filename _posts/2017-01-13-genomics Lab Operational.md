Happy New Years and the Miller Lab / The Sam Noble Museum Genomics Core Lab is coomplete! I have begun the task of ddRAD-seq library prep on the samples I have collected and requested from various museums.

This begins the genomics work of my dissertation! Needless to say its like Christmas in the Miller Lab. 

DNA extraction has begun. Stay tuned, libraries should be complete in a month. 

Have a good one everyone, and try to stay warm.
